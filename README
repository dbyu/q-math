This is my repository for mathematical and statistical functions
that I have written in q/kdb+. It is random and scattered at the
moment, but at some point I will write a manual for how to use
these effectively once this library has reached a critical mass 
of perhaps 20 functions or so.

highlights:
LSF is a generalized least-squares fit function, compact form.
LSF2 works to higher orders, but is about twice as slow.
QR is a decomposition of a square matrix into eigenvectors.
gamma is the gamma function - 2nd argument is how many terms to
 use in spouge's approximation (much more concise than lanczos's
 approximation). for \P 7 in q/kdb+, 5 or 6 works, e.g.
 gamma[0.75;5] -> 1.2254167024 (Abramowitz & Stegun, chapter 6).
