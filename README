This is my repository for mathematical and statistical functions
that I have written in q/kdb+. It is random and scattered at the
moment, but at some point I will write a manual for how to use
these effectively once this library has reached a critical mass 
of perhaps 30 functions or so, or when I implement all of the
routines in chapters 14/15 of Numerical Recipes in C.

highlights:
LSF is a generalized least-squares fit function, compact form.
LSF2 works to higher orders, but is about twice as slow.
LM is Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting algorithm - easily
 the most difficult routine to code out of the bunch so far.
QR is a decomposition of a square matrix into eigenvectors, can
 also find eigenvalues (specify in 2nd argument).
HH outputs tridiagonal form of a square matrix - would like to
 make this more concise at some point.
gamma is the gamma function - 2nd argument is how many terms to
 use in spouge's approximation (much more concise than lanczos's
 approximation). for \P 7 in q/kdb+, 5 or 6 works, e.g.
 gamma[0.75;5] returns 1.22417 (1.2254167024 in Abramowitz & 
 Stegun, chapter 6).
