This is my repository for mathematical and statistical functions
that I have written in q/kdb+. It is random and scattered at the
moment, but at some point I will write a manual for how to use
these effectively once this library has reached a critical mass 
of perhaps 20 functions or so.

highlights:
LSF is a generalized least-squares fit function, compact form.
LSF2 works to higher orders, but is about twice as slow.
QR is a decomposition of a square matrix into eigenvectors.
gamma is the gamma function - 2nd argument is how many terms to
  use in the approximation. for \P 7 in q/kdb+, 5 or 6 works.
